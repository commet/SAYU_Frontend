# SAYU Frontend Build Errors Summary

## 🚨 Major Issues Found:

### 1. Import Path Issues
- `@/shared/SAYUTypeDefinitions` not resolving properly
- Need to use `@sayu/shared` instead

### 2. Missing TypeScript Declarations
- gamification API functions not exported correctly
- Several interface mismatches

### 3. Type Mismatches
- DashboardStats vs UserPoints interface conflicts
- LeaderboardEntry missing properties
- Various `any` type issues

### 4. Missing Dependencies
- ✅ sonner - installed
- Several Radix UI compatibility issues with React 19

## 🔧 Quick Fixes Applied:

1. ✅ Added missing gamification types (XPEventType, LeaderboardType, etc.)
2. ✅ Fixed tsconfig.json paths for @/shared
3. ✅ Installed sonner package
4. 🔄 Working on shared module imports

## 📋 Next Steps Needed:

1. **Fix @sayu/shared imports** - Replace all @/shared imports with @sayu/shared
2. **Add missing API exports** - Ensure all functions are properly exported
3. **Resolve interface conflicts** - Align DashboardStats with expected types
4. **Test build process** - Verify compilation works

## ⚠️ Recommendation:

The codebase has extensive TypeScript errors that need systematic fixing. 
For the PR to be mergeable, we should either:

1. **Quick fix**: Add `// @ts-ignore` to critical errors temporarily
2. **Proper fix**: Systematically resolve all type issues (time-intensive)
3. **Hybrid approach**: Fix critical compilation blockers, defer warnings

Current priority: **Get it building first, then refine types**.
