   - Application type: "Web application"
   - Name: "SAYU Auth"

5. **Configure Authorized Redirect URIs**
   Add ALL of these URIs:
   ```
   https://hgltvdshuyfffskvjmst.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
   http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

   - Paste the Client Secret in "Google Client Secret"
   
2. **Save the configuration**
   - Click "Save" button

## Test the Setup

1. Clear browser cache and cookies for localhost:3000
2. Open browser console (F12) to see debug logs
3. Try logging in with Google
4. Check console for any error messages

## Common Issues

### "Provider not enabled" error
- Make sure Google provider is enabled in Supabase dashboard

### Redirect URI mismatch error
- Ensure ALL redirect URIs are added in Google Cloud Console
- URIs must match exactly (including http/https and trailing slashes)

### PKCE verification failed
- Clear browser cookies and try again
- This usually happens when auth flow is interrupted

### No error but redirects back to login
- Check browser console for detailed logs
- Verify session cookies are being set properly
- Check if third-party cookies are blocked in browser

## Debug Information

When clicking Google login, check browser console for:
- üîê Auth Provider: google
- üìç App URL: http://localhost:3000
- üîÑ Redirect URL: http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
- üîó Redirecting to: (Google OAuth URL)

If you see all these logs but still get redirected back, the issue is likely with the callback handling or session creation.
