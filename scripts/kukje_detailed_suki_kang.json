    "description": "강서경의 개인전 '마치'는 시간, 공간, 그리고 개인적 뿌리내림의 주제를 탐구합니다. 작가는 전통 한국 악보에서 영감을 받은 격자 기반 구성을 사용하며, '정(Jeong)' (공간적 틀)과 '모라(Mora)' (시간의 단위)에 집중하여 개인적 시간과 계절적 전환을 검토하는 신작 회화와 조각을 선보입니다.",
    "description_en": "Suki Seokyeong Kang's solo exhibition 'MARCH' explores themes of time, space, and individual rootedness through her unique conceptual approach. She uses grid-based compositions inspired by traditional Korean musical notation and focuses on 'Jeong' (spatial framework) and 'Mora' (unit of time), presenting new paintings and sculptures that examine personal time and seasonal transitions.",
