# 🎨 SAYU Exhibition Data Integration - Batch 2 Status Report

## 📋 Task Overview
**Objective**: Integrate 21 additional exhibitions (145-165) into the SAYU platform's exhibition database system.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Infrastructure Setup
- **Parser Tool Created**: `quick-exhibition-parser-batch2.js`
- **Enhanced Features**:
  - Special venue handling (N/A, multi-venue)
  - Priority assignment (40+ range for Batch 2)
  - Major museum flagging (호암미술관, 부산현대미술관, 서울시립미술관)
  - Proper exhibition numbering (145-165)

### 2. Enhanced Processing Capabilities
- **Multi-venue Support**: "서울시립미술관 본관 외 3곳" → processed automatically
- **Unknown Venue Handling**: "N/A" → marked as "미정" with special flags
- **Genre Classification**: Enhanced for Korean cultural content (백자, 도자, 해양문화)
- **Priority System**: Batch 2 starts from priority 40+ to avoid conflicts

### 3. Database Schema Compatibility
- **Table**: `exhibitions_clean` (ready for Batch 2)
- **New Fields Added**:
  - `venue_original_name` - preserves complex venue names
  - `is_multi_venue` - flags multi-location exhibitions
  - `is_unknown_venue` - flags exhibitions with unclear venues
  - `batch` - tracks data batch number
  - `exhibition_number` - sequential numbering (145-165)

### 4. Documentation Updated
- **Migration Guide**: Updated with Batch 2 instructions
- **Processing Flow**: Clear step-by-step process documented
